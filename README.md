# Covid-19
This project has been made with the help of python and SQL. 
It analyses the latest data regarding the Covid-19 cases in India
The data has been taken from the official website(covidindia.org)
This project has been created to sort out particular data and then segregate them as the user wants
for better understanding, Bar charts and Line charts have also been included. They are helpful for easy comparison between the status of diffeerent states of the country.
We have created a Main Menu which contains what all can be displayed on the user's command.
The use of CSV files has made the transfer of data from sql to python very easy.
On the basis of what the user inputs, the data will be displayed accordingly.
